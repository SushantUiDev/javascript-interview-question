Q.how to find index Occurance ?
=>
var str="this is my is world"
str.indexOf("is")  ;    //  it return  6 because (it will return first occurance.) 
str.lastIndexOf("is")  // it will return last occurance of element. 

=>basically indexOf method is used for single alphabet.
=>zero is a first position in string.
