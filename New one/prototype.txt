Q.what is prototype in javascript?
=>Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object; 
=>by default every function have property called prototype.
=>bydefault this property is empty and we can add property and method to it.
=>if we cretae instace of an object then all property and method will inherits to its instance.
=>if i have a method called getJ() in parent and i create 1000 of instace of object then for every instace getJ() method is available.

  so the solution is prototype.
 {objectName}.{prototype}.{method}

=>this time for every instance of object getJ() method is not present and insted of it will search up meanse its parent 


=> so this way our object is very small.
