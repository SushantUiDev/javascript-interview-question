Q.Does JavaScript support OOP ?
==========================
=>javascript is a object oriented programming language because it support inheritance through prototype.

=>inheritance and encapsulation are only two technique in javascripyt as oop.

=>in  js object are main thing meanse every thing in js is a object.(string,boolean ,number,variable,method etc are all object).

=> we normally used object literal and constructor to create object

object literal:
=============
var obj={};
obj.sname="sush"
obj.lname="paikrao"

constructor based:
==============
function person(){
this.name="sush";
this.lname="paikrao"
}

var obj=new person();
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Encapsulation**
===============
=>enclosing all property,functionality in to that object so object internal working is hidden from rest of the application.
=>it allows us to abstract some specific functionality on object.

**inheritance**
=============
=>in this object being  able to inheritance its property to its child.  
=>in js it can done by prototype.


ex:
function person(){

}

var manager=new person();

=>in this person is parent and manager is its child we can say it is instance of parent object.
=>so manager(child)   can have its own property and method and inherites property and method from person(parent).
