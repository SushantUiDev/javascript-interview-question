Q.function Person() {} var person = Person() var person = new Person()?
=>1. function Person() {} 
Declares a function (but does not execute it).
It will usually have some code between the curly brackets.

2. var person = Person()
Declares a variable (person), invokes a function (Person) and sets the value of person to the return of the function.

3. var person = new Person()
Creates a new instance of an object based on the Person function. So the variable (person) is now an Object, not just a string or a number.
