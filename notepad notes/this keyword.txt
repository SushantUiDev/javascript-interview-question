What is "this"? What is its value ?
=>this is a keyword in javascript .
=>in js its behaviour is laxical meanse its behaviour depends on where we write it .
=>if we write it outside the function then it acts as global function just like window meanse 
   "this===window" = true. (any mode)
=>ex .    var person = {
    firstName: "Penelope",
    lastName: "Barrymore",
    fullName: function () {
        ?// Notice we use "this" just as we used "he" in the example sentence earlier?:?
        console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
    ?// We could have also written this:??
        console.log(person.firstName + " " + person.lastName);(may cause ambiguity error)
    }
}
